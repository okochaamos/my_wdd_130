    <p>Greetings to you all. I am Nigerian. I am looking towards having a Bachelor's degree in Software Development. I love playing football, good music and travelling.<p>
    <p>I am married with two kids, Bryan and Jane, wonderful kids and currently working with Monie Point MFB, as a business relationship manager.<p>
    <p>I know we are required to learn as much as we can to improve upon our skills and for us to better disciple leader. This path I have undertaken will aid me in achieving my long awaited dream.<p>
