      superior personal service, hiring only the best guides and using the highest quality, highly maintained equipment to 
      share the Kenai River with our guests.  We are proud to offer Dryoar river rafting trips,  Dryoar guided fishing and

    <h4>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h4>
    <P class = rivers1 > 
      <img src="images/rivers1.jpg" alt="page 2 wireframe"> 

      Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho

      Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given 
      the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of 
      folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
      Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also 
      commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over 
      the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed. Let's not forget 
      the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United 
      States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, 
      slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who 
      like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

      Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate 
      land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone 
      cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs 
      from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
      interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great 
      whitewater opportunities.

      Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.Desolation Canyon has been recognized 
      as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon 
      tells.

    <h5>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h5>
    <p class = rivers2>
      <img src ="images/rivers2.jpg" alt = "river image">
      Grand Canyon, Arizona

      This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your 
      visit to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking 
      scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
      whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.

      CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically 
      rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most 
      people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
