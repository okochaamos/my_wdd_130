    <p>
      Our roots lie deep in the Kenai River. Our company was one of the first oar powered outfitters to run on the 
      upper Kenai River, dating back to 1974. For over 40 years we have built our operations to be based upon delivering 
      superior personal service, hiring only the best guides and using the highest quality, highly maintained equipment to 
      share the Kenai River with our guests.  We are proud to offer Dryoar river rafting trips,  Dryoar guided fishing and 
      Dryoar cabin rentals all on the beautiful Upper Kenai River and thru the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge thru our special 
      use permits.
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
      physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
      adventures you are seeking, Dryoar Water Rafting Company can make it
      happen for you.
